#Scraping tousbenevoles.org

tousbenevoles.org is a website presenting various missions for volunteers.

The point of this project was to extract all information about missions & structures, to build a volunteer missions database : 
- structure : name, address, contact's mail & phone
- missions : title, description, skills, additional information, update date

Some of these items can bea scraped from html tags and others need to be scraped from java/php calls included into the html code.

Scraping is done with BeautifulSoup
